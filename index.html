    <p>
    Northern red oak is a medium to large, variable deciduous tree [39,47].
    It is the tallest and most rapidly growing of the oaks [20] and commonly
    reaches 65 to 98 feet (20-30 m) in height and 2 to 3 feet (61-91 m) in
    diameter [101].  On extremely favorable sites plants may grow to 160
    feet (49 m) and up to 8 feet (2.4 m) in diameter [24].  Trees are tall,
    straight, and columnar with a large crown in forested stands but are
    characterized by a short bole and spreading crown in openings [101].
    Plants generally have a strongly developed taproot and a network of
    deep, spreading laterals [47,56].  The gray to grayish-brown bark has
    shallow vertical furrows and low ridges and becomes checkered with age
    [39].

    <p> 
    Northern red oak is monoecious.  Staminate catkins are borne in leaf
    axils of the previous year's growth, whereas pistillate catkins occur in
    two- to many-flowered spikes in the axils of leaves [101].  The acorns
    are approximately 0.8 to 1.3 inch (20-33 mm) in length, with a shallow,
    saucer-shaped cup [26,39,47].  Acorns are borne singly or in clusters of
    two to five [101].  The nut contains a large, white, bitter kernel [20].
